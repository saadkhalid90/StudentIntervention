    "\n",
    "***Logistic regression: ***\n",
    "Logistic regression can be used for fault detection in industrial printing. The features used in this application are sensor readings from various machine parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the outcome of ogistic regression is log odds of the outcome, we can evaluate and interpret the probabilities of the outcomes (on the basis of which classification is done). Additionally, because of the model's simplicity, the coefficients of the features can also be interpreted easily to gain additional insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression however assumes that the relationship between the features and the log odds of the binary outcome is linear. Hence it is not a good choice in situations where that is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe the simplicity and interpretability of the model makes it a good candidate for the problem of detecting likelihood of student failure. The coefficients obtained by fitting the model for the deographic and educational features of students can be used in designing targeted interventions. Moreover, I also believe the regularization feature of logistic regression can be used for reducing variance/ overfitting and improving prediction performance on test student data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Adaboost: *** \n",
    "One of the real life applications of Adaboost is face detection in images and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost does not make any linearity assumptions as in case of Logistic Regression. The model can also handle high dimensional problems very well. On the down side however, because of being computationally intensive, the model may be slow to fit on larger and high dimensional datasets. Moreover, the model is not very interpretable since the ensemble consists of numerous adaptively grown trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as an ensemble method that learns slowly, adaboost generally avoids overfitting and gives superior predictive performance on test data on most datasets. Hence, we can ignore one of its major weaknesses i.e. computational inefficiency (which is not very important for our problem since our dataset is not too large).\n",
    "*** SVMs: ***\n",
    "SVMs are used in bio-medical laboratories to identify cancer types given patients gene chip data. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs can also perform well on spaces that are not linearly separable (by using the kernel trick). Additionally, SVM models can be regulrized using tuning parameters to give optimal performance. And finally, since SVM can be defined as a complex optimization problem, it finds a global minimum. On the downside however, the algorithm becomes increasingly slower as the size of the data set increases. SVM may not be a best choice in problems where different classes are nor clearly separable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though logistic regression is a simple, interpretable and useful choice given our model, the linearity assumption between the features and the log odds is possibly not true in case of our dataset. Given this limitation, SVM is a valid alternative to test on our dataset. Morover, SVMs can also be regularized via tunable parameters to avoid overfitting on training student data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, given our dataset is not too large, poor scalability of SVM is not a major concern for the problem at hand.  \n",

The variable of interest in the problem at hand is a binary outcome ('yes' if a student fails and 'no' otherwise). Logistic Regression can be thought of as a mathemetical model that maps a set of input variables (student characteristics in the dataset) to a probability of the outcome (binary variable of interest). The evaluated probability is used to classify or predict the binary outcome of interest (student failure in our case). Initially we need student data  to train a model that can later generalize well and predict failure for any student whose data has not been used to train the model. Therefore we need to take measures and make sure that the model can not only explain the data reasonably well (not perfectly) so that it can also generalize and predict failure for any unseen student input variables.

    "The f1 score of the optimal model obtained using the GridCV appraoch is 0.8028. It is slightly lesser 0.8060, the test f1 score obtained by a simple validation approach (The parameter settings can be seen in the cell above). Initially, I was confused as to why the optimal f1 score is lesser than the f1 score for a model with default parameter settings. But later, I realized that the disparity can be explained by the fact that the former has been evaluated by using the 10-fold cross validation wheras the latter was just obtained by a simple validation approach (training set size = 300, test set size = 95).
